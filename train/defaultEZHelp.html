<p class="instructions">Ideally, you should create your own first help

the more generic help. In your HTML for a page, do something like 
the following:</p>

	<h1>Quick help on how to use EZ Access:</h1>
	<p>The EZ Access buttons allow you to hear about the things you can do with 
	this kiosk and to make choices. Screens on this kiosk may have many items on 
	them. First, you will move to the item you want with the EZ Up & Down arrows. 
	Then, you will need to use the EZ Action button to choose that item.</p>

	<p>You will usually start near the top of each screen. The EZ Down arrow 
	will move you down to the next item. 
	If you do not want that item, you can use the EZ Down arrow again. 
	To go up to a previous item, use the EZ Up arrow.</p>

	<p>The round EZ Action button chooses an item. 
	After moving to the item you want, you will then need to choose that item 
	by pressing the EZ Action button.</p>

<h1>How to use EZ Help:</h1>

<p>You can press the diamond-shaped EZ Help button for help at any time 
while using this kiosk.</p>

<p>Then use the EZ Up and Down arrow buttons to move through the help 
instructions, and use the round EZ Action button to repeat a help 
instruction item.</p>

<p>You can also press the EZ Help button twice to stop the speech whenever 
you are not already in EZ Help.</p>
</section>

<h4 class="instructions">Layer 3</h4>
<section>
<h1>How to use Button Help:</h1>

<p>When Button Help is turned on, the keys, buttons, and on-screen items 
do nothing except say their name and function. 
This lets you safely explore and learn about the keyboard keys,
the EZ Access buttons, and all of the buttons and information items that 
are shown on the screen.</p>

<p>To use Button Help, hold down the diamond-shaped EZ Help button,
and then press any other key or button, or touch any item on the screen 
to learn about it.</p>

<p>Button Help can also be locked on by pressing the EZ Help button 
five times in a row.</p>

<section>
	<h1>How to use EZ Access</h1>
	<p>The EZ Access buttons on the keypad allow you to hear about the things 
	you can do with this kiosk and to make choices. The kiosk will read to you 
	through headphones when you use EZ Access. It will stop reading to you when 
	you touch the rest of the screen.</p>

	<p>Screens on this kiosk may have many items on them, such as 
	words, pictures, buttons, and checkboxes. 
	You can use the EZ Up &amp; Down buttons to move through these items. 
	You will then use the round EZ Action button to make choices.</p>

	<p>To learn how to use the EZ Access buttons, let's start with the 
	EZ Down arrow. The EZ Down arrow is a yellow button at the bottom of the 
	EZ Access keypad. It is shaped like a triangle with the point down. 
	Press it now to go to the next help screen.</p>
</section>

<h4 class="instructions">Tutorial Layer 2</h4>
<section>
	<h1>How to find the EZ Access buttons</h1>
	<p>There are eight EZ Access buttons on the keypad below the screen. 
	You can use these buttons to operate this kiosk instead of trying to 
	read, reach, or use the touchscreen.</p>

	<p>Two of the buttons are very important. They are the EZ Down &amp; 
	EZ Action buttons. The EZ Down arrow is the yellow button at the bottom 
	of the keypad, which is shaped like a triangle with the point down. 
	The green EZ Action button is in the lower right corner of the keypad 
	and is a circle shape.</p>

	<p>Press the EZ Down arrow button now to learn more about these 
	important buttons.</p>
</section>

<h4 class="instructions">Tutorial Layer 3</h4>
<section>
	<h1>How to use the EZ Access buttons</h1>
	<p>You will usually start near the top of each screen. 
	The EZ Down arrow will move you down to the next item. 
	If you do not want that item, you can use the EZ Down arrow again. 
	The EZ Down arrow only moves and does not activate items or make any 
	changes.</p>

	<p>The round EZ Action button is to the right of the EZ Down arrow. 
	It is used to choose items. After moving to the item you want, you will 
	then need to choose that item by pressing the EZ Action button. 
	Because you will start near the top of each screen, to operate this kiosk
	you will usually arrow down several times and then press EZ Action.</p>

	<p>Press the EZ Down arrow button now to learn more about moving on the 
	screen.</p>
</section>

<h4 class="instructions">Tutorial Layer 4</h4>
<section>
	<h1>How to move through screens</h1>
	<p>The EZ Down arrow moves down to the next item on the screen. 
	The EZ Up arrow is the opposite, and moves up to the previous item 
	on the screen.</p>

	<p>The EZ Up arrow is just above the EZ Down arrow on the keypad. 
	If you went past something you wanted when using the EZ Down arrow,
	you can move back up to it with the EZ Up arrow.</p>

	<p>You can do everything you need to do on this kiosk using three buttons:
	EZ Up, Down, &amp; Action. To exit help and start using this kiosk, press the 
	blue, diamond-sharn about the other EZ Access buttons, 
	press the EZ Down arrow to get to the next help screen.</p>
</section>

<h4 class="instructions">Tutorial Layer 5</h4>
<section>
	<h1>How to use the other EZ Access buttons</h1>
	<p>Above and to the left of the EZ Up arrow is the Back page button.
	Above and to the right of the EZ Up arrow is the Next page button.</p>

	<p>The EZ Back &amp; Next buttons are similar to turning pages in a book. 
	You may wish to go back to a previous screen to make changes or fix a mistake.
	To go back to a previous screen, press the EZ Back button. 
	On some screens, you can move forward to the next screen by pressing the 
	EZ Next button.</p>

	<p>Help is available on every screen. 
	You can get or exit help at any time by pressing the EZ Help button. 
	It is the blue button, which is shaped like a diamond and has small 
	raised dot or bump on it.</p>

	<p>The buttons at the top left and right corners of the keypad can be 
	used to decrease or increase the headphone volume.</p>
